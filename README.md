1. TicTacToeGame: Here we identify the main classes/components involved which is players, a board, and playingpieces. The playing pieces will be of 2 types X,O. We will create them as an enum named PlayingPieceType. We create 2 classes with the name PlayingPieceX, PlayingPieceO which has 'is-a' relationship with the class PlayingPiece. The board  object contains 'has-a' relationship with the PlayingPiece and it has a size. We also have Players in the system who will actually play the game. Now there's a class which runs the whole thing and it goes by the name 'Game'. Main classes just runs the game.
